In our new era of computing where advancements in conversational UIs and artificial intelligence are enabling users in new ways, it's easy to be tempted to take an existing visual-based app or GUI and simply 'convert it to voice'. But while voice brings with it the potential for speed and simplicity, hands-free experiences can become overly complicated easily when based on another mode of interaction. Get the scoop on what types of use cases transfer well to voice interactions and why. ",

Topics include the new concurrent copying garbage collector (GC) based on read barriers, and improvements to the ahead-of-time (AOT) and just-in-time (JIT) compiler. The new GC reduces pause times and heap sizes compared to its predecessor. Improvements to the compiler include Class Hierarchy Analysis (CHA) to reduce the overhead of virtual calls, new induction variable analysis and loop optimization, a vectorizer to take advantage of SIMD instructions, and a diverse set of optimizations specifically targeted at improving Android application performance. The impact of each optimization is demonstrated with real-life benchmark and application performance improvements.",

Yet users are regularly bogged down by slow page loads, delayed interactivity after page load, high input latency on critical interactions (tap, click, scroll etc), and janky animations or scrolling. These negative experiences turn away users and hurt businesses.\n\nDevelopers need to measure performance in the real world to get insight into their users' experiences on the myriad configurations of devices and networks. Unfortunately, many of the techniques used today don't capture the right metrics or make performance worse.\n\nThis talk will cover the new metrics and platform APIs that enable user-centric performance measurement, both in the lab and the real world. We'll show how developers can track down problems, understand their root causes, and prevent future regressions to ensure users consistently get a great experience.",
